CAIsr is a software repository containing tools and imaging workflows that are either developed or contributed to at the Centre for Advanced Imaging, 
University of Queensland.

It enables the researcher to promote and provide the original code used in developing the imaging pipeline/workflow and offers version control via GitHub.

This website briefly describes the tools and software used in developing these imaging workflows. It introduces data conversion
for various image formats used at CAI and an explanation of the imaging workflows.

Additional information on the imaging workflows or tools can be obtained by following the above links.

All source code is provided at [CAIsr](https://github.com/CAIsr) Github page.
