DCS is a server to control camera remotely via socket communication

It contains BananaCam written in C and wraps gphoto2 with additional functionalities.

An interface can easily control Digital Control Server by sending specific messages.

Additional details about installation and instructions can be found []()

This toolbox depends on libgphoto2 and libpthread and can be used on both Linux and Mac OSX. 
For Mac OSX it also requires IOKit framework CoreFundation.

Note: We have also provided a test dockerfile for DCS, although it has not been tested with a camera.
Dockerfile inspired from https://hyfrmn.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/install-libgphoto2-and-gphoto2-from-source-on-raspberry-pi/
