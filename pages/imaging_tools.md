title: Imaging tools  
description: Overview of CAI imaging tools
---

At CAI we have developed imaging workflows using multiple software tools such as MINC, FSL, SPM, FreeSurfer, Nipype etc.
These workflows may use either individual or a combination of the software toolbox mentioned below. 

In this page we provide a brief description of these tools and their functionality.

a) MINC:
Minc toolbox uses minc data format. 


b) FSL:

c) SPM:

d) MATLAB:

e) Python:

f) FreeSurfer:

g) Mipav:

h) Niypype: Nipype is an open source neuroimaging toolbox based on python language.

It enables researchers to design imaging workflow using multiple software packages of their choice. This facilitates 
collaboration with different packages and interaction with different imaging tools offered by them. The user can select their
choice of software tool to perform certain imaging tasks and design their own workflow.

The nipype workflow is a streamlined process which uses several nodes to accomplish the desired imaging task. Each node provides a 
specific imaging task that is part of the mapflow of the imaging pipeline.
