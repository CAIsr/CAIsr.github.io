description: Overview of CAI imaging tools

At CAI we have developed imaging workflows using multiple software tools such as MINC, FSL, SPM, FreeSurfer, Nipype etc.
These workflows may use either individual or a combination of the software toolbox mentioned below. 

In this page we provide a brief description of these tools and their functionality.

   Python is a friendly and easy to learn software language. It can run on almost all major operating systems
   . In addition it can also be used for either web-based or stand-alone applications. [Python](https://ww.python.org/)
   is object oriented language and can support both multi-processing and multi-threading.
   
   Some of its features include dynamic type system, automatic memory management and it is supported by both a comprehensive
   standard library and open-source contributions by its users.
   
   [Python](https://ww.python.org/) license is administered by Python Software Foundation and is an open-source license.
   
   At CAI we use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as our choice of Python interpreter which further allows us to interface
   other software toolbox such as Nipype, FreeSurfer, FSL etc.
   
   The following features provided by [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) make it so attractive:
   
   * Intelligent code assistance
   
   * Powerful debugger and fast refactoring
   
   * Version control with Git, SVN, Mercurial etc. for remote development
   
   * Provision of database tools such as SQL server
   
   * Web-development with frameworks such as Django, Flask, Google App Engine etc. In 
   addition to support for Javascript, CoffeeScript, HTML and CSS
   
   * Interactive console and support for scientific tools such as Numpy, Matplotlib etc.

   Nipype is an open source neuroimaging toolbox based on python language.
   
   It enables researchers to design imaging workflow using multiple software packages of their choice. This facilitates 
   collaboration with different packages and interaction with different imaging tools offered by them. The user can select their
   choice of software tool to perform certain imaging tasks and design their own workflow.

   The nipype workflow is a streamlined process which uses several nodes to accomplish the desired imaging task. Each node provides a 
   specific imaging task that is part of the mapflow of the imaging pipeline.
