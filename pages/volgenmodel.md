description: Overview of Volgenmodel

Volgenmodel creates nonlinear models from a series of input MINC files - modelling was originally created as part 
of the ANDI project funded by DCRC.

The workflow is similar to that of 'Volgenmodel-Nipype' described in the following section.

This source code is based on perl script.
